## ***X-ray-Chest-Diagnosis***
Classification of Bacteria-infected and Virus infected chest.

## ${Project \space Overview}$

This project works on ***the Preprocessing and Classification of the Scanned Images of Xrays Diagrams of Chest*** within three categories, ***first***, Normal Chest, ***second***, Bacteria Infected Chest, and ***third***, Virus Infected Chest. Thus, the images are resized and then the model is trained with the accuracy of ***82% (approx.)***. Since, the ***diseases by viruses and bacteria are different*** and show different morphological symptoms. Thus, the project is suitable and best needed for ***diagnosis of patient about various diseases of Trunk***. It can also be enhanced further to improve its accuracy by ***Data Augmentation***. The ***Project Structure*** contains the details of the data contained within the subfolders.
